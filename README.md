This is a template.
There is an automation; Updating the license every 24 hours if there are changes.
By default, this is disabled.
Go to .github, and rename or remove LicLock.
The only other change you should make is changing .github/funding.yml
Either change the names, or, remove the file if you don't have GitHub sponsors setup.
If you don't change it, people will be donating to me, NOT you.

> [!TIP]
> If you have a modified version of Bspace<br>
> You should leave LicLock as it is.
